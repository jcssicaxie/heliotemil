                <h2>History</h2>
                    <h3>1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
                        <p>
                            A Ready-To-Wear collection presented by brothers Julius Juul and Victor Juul from Copenhagen, Denmark. Exploring the lines between form and function driven by experimental approaches, HELIOT EMIL™ pushes the semantic dialogue within the creative industry. A subversive scandinavian and monochromatic aesthetic, combined with custom developed materials, fabrics and trimmings, HELIOT EMIL™ entices a high attention to detail throughout every branch. Designer Julius Juul draws on thought provoking themes and a curiosity about creative expression reflected in every collection by HELIOT EMIL™.

                    <h3>2. FOUNDATION</h3>
                        <p>
                            Since the first collection was showcased in Milan during spring / summer 17 season, HELIOT EMIL™ has continually expropriated its exploration of the creative milieu. The aesthetic is carefully developed with custom fabrics, hardware trimmings and materials. Each hardware detail is created from the bottom up with form and function in mind. Experimentation and a high attention to detail is ensured by partnering only with the best in their category and industry. A tight-bond with all partners allows for a coherent evolution of the brand aesthetic. With painstaking attention to detail each garment is conceived from a collective ideation for each season standing in relation to the brand as a whole.

                    <h3>3. FUTURE</h3>
                        <p>
                            The subsequent phase for HELIOT EMIL™ will see a further cementation of the brand and an expansion of the semantic dialogue with the creative milieu. The core value of the brand will be explored without compromise, through both physical spaces enticing further ideas of form and function, and experiences expressing the innovative nature of the brand. Underlying the continuous organic development is a coherent understanding of the brand developed in close proximity with all partners.
