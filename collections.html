        <p>Heliot Emil steps into the world of Womenswear with their SS19 offering, titled ‘Referential Transparency.’</p>
        <p>Referential Transparency refersto a computer programming expression - a function is said to be referentially transparent if its replaceable - the collection offers up an exploration on how much of our personalities are replaceable. The resulting collection experiments with the balance of form and functionality, presented in a range of fabrications across both Men’s and Womenswear.</p>
        <p>Running parallel to the strong foundations of their Menswear component, Heliot Emil showcased their first Womenswear collection that highlighted the multifaceted, detailed nature of the brand. The brand’s SS19 runway at Copenhagen Fashion Week shined the spotlight on strong, conceptual details in a monochrome palette that maintained the focus on design and function.</p>

        <p>In typical HELIOT EMIL fashion, the collection encompasses a neutral monochromatic color palette featuring black, gray, silver and taupe. As the designer of the brand, Julius Juul takes an experimental approach towards not only garment construction, but also toward utilitarian design. This is exhibited by the brand’s usage of custom textiles, like its signature metal liquid fabric, and by cutout pieces that have a graceful presentation on the body.</p>

        <p>The new collection showcases tailored garments and casual ensembles, with each having an elevated appeal. Tailored garments, including blazers and pants, feature asymmetrical designs with reconstructed fabric detailing, which are then accented by hardware embellishments like silver carabiners and waist-cinching black leather belts. More tailored looks include pants paired with ribbed form-fitting knitwear with side slits.</p>
            
        <p>Street-focused offerings feature garments constructed from nylon, leather, cotton and the brand’s silver metal liquid fabric. These garments include sheer cutout and cropped tops, oversized cross-weave knitwear, wind-breaker jackets, utility pants with speckled detailing and more.
            
            Topping off the collection are accessories such as leather bags with hardware details, crochet balaclavas and a range of leather shoes.</p>

        <p>This was the label’s third time showing in Paris, and this collection was consistent with those that came before; dark, dystopian, and focused on proportion play and material development (the fabric in look 14 was melted, for example). Recently designers have been talking about customizable or convertible clothing; Juul is fully committed. The zippers that snaked beautifully around legs are all fully functional, some open and close fabric, others allow whole sections of the garment to be removed or reattached. Snaps serve the same purpose and Juul noted that the brand will be posting a video demonstrating 55 different ways that one of the jackets in the fall line-up can be refigured.</p>
        <p>The collection took its name from a work by the artist who inspired the collection, the British sculptor Henry Moore. Juul explained the appeal: “He does these quite large, semi-abstract sculptures where he really sort of messes with the dynamics of the human body so you can see that there are some shapes—some legs or some forms—but it’s stretched in an interesting or weird way. And then depending on what angle you see it from, you really feel like it’s alive in different ways.” It was difficult to see this at work in the collection, which, with its down-filled knotted ties, seemed to owe more to the bondage erotica of Nobuyoshi Araki; the show opened with a model with a strap across her breast. A few looks later a model’s arms were bound to create a kind of Empire shape. This kind of styling was mostly applied to women’s looks. The divide between the exposure of the female looks and the concealment—to the point of almost menacing anonymity—of the men’s was even greater than last season. When asked about this, Juul explained that he was seeking to balance the values expressed in the brand ethos of “industrial elegance.” “What I think is considered elegant is also something that’s maybe a bit more exposed or vulnerable in a way, and then what’s considered more industrial is something that is a bit more rough and hard.” This sounds like another way of saying girls are soft and men are the opposite.</p>
        <p>It was disappointing to find such an old-fashioned dichotomy at Heliot Emil, which in many other ways is a futuristic and refreshingly nostalgia-free brand. Juul is “look into the future kind of person,” who has been fascinated with technology since he was a boy. He sees the future as dystopian, “but in an interesting way more than a scary way.”</p>
        <p>The full-face balaclavas worn by the male models were frightening. Juul said he was after the idea of anonymity and drawing attention to the silhouettes. Many of those, like the second look, featuring an “obscure monster of down” were inflated, but in many cases could be streamlined by using the customized fastenings. As always there was a protective element in the clothes; this season some of that was created using spongy compression knits and molds to create dimensions and shapes, which complimented the softness of the down pieces, including boot covers.</p>
        <p>It was the sharp tailored pieces, especially those with zippers, that really lit the imagination with their combination of precision and adaptability. You might even say they were “fire.”</p>

        <p>Julius and Victor Juul’s HELIOT EMIL is the master of utilitarian, futuristic, form and function-focused attire. Building its brand on such codes equates to a loyal following, one that yesterday turned out in force for the brand’s Spring/Summer 2023 show, “Primal Substance.”</p>
        <p>Taking inspiration from Bill Viola’s art piece Martyrs Composite, the Juul boys look at how water, earth, fire and air can impact and influence the body. Through fabric manipulation and technological studies, HELIOT EMIL offers heat-reactive fabrics, water resistance, and more nuanced design details like creating seams inspired by the contour lines of the world, or inflating pieces in wind tunnels. Nothing is too avant-garde for HELIOT EMIL, a vanguard that has previously explored liquid metal-effect clothing, and today, a collaboration with Alpinestars, known for its motorbiking apparel.</p>
        <p>Rubber shoes, heels clad in metal, knee-high boots and that Alpinestar collab came with force, bolstered with motorbike cues like shoulder reinforcement and padding. Wind was referenced in the ruching and folding of leather for biker jackets, Earth through the aforementioned seams and also zippers, a strong visual for the brand.</p>
        <p>Returning to plan, piercing AI techno welcomed denim pants and satin tops, as well as a full Alpinestars body suit seen alongside a new structural HELIOT EMIL bag.

            The laser-cut fabric was seemingly a part of the trousers it hung from, displaying the house’s logo. Likewise, it was used for a hook for tops and bras, bag charms, and sling hooks too.</p>
            <p>Together, the Juul boys presented a clean and confident follow-up to their work before, doubling down on house cues while honing in on what makes it unique: the wearability of what could seem so far fetched, but is in fact, the new vanguard of techwear and more.</p>

        <p>Fashion brand Heliot Emil unveiled its Spring Summer 2024 collection with a fashion show held on Tuesday, September 26th, during the recently finished Paris Fashion Week. The Heliot Emil Spring Summer 2024 collection, provocatively titled ‘The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis,’ delves into the realm of mathematics and nature, drawing its inspiration from a seminal 1952 article penned by the brilliant mathematician and computer scientist, Alan Turing. In this groundbreaking work, Turing masterfully elucidated the intricate interplay between mathematical algorithms and the formation of unique patterns in the natural world.</p>
        <p>This fascinating exploration led the Creative Director of Heliot Emil, Julius Juul, on a journey to encapsulate the mesmerizing dynamics and profound complexities of morphogenesis within the contours of a fashion collection. The result is a mesmerizing fusion of distinctive textures and patterns intertwined with meticulously calculated mathematical principles.</p>
