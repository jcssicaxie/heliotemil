                                The HELIOT EMIL SS21 collection titled ‘Compos Mentis’ explores an inspiration in the idea of having full control of one’s mind. Designer Julius Juul was conspicuously fascinated with the concept of cognitive neuroenhancement or what is more commonly known as the Placebo Effect. The interest led to an exploration of the fundamental nature of mental well-being.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Psychologist Professor Robert Plutchik’s theory defines that there are eight basic emotions within the human spectrum. Fear, anger, sadness, disgust, joy, surprise, trust and anticipation. The outcome of each of these emotions is completely up to the cognitive perception. The emotions are visualized in an emotion-wheel and in-between the eight core emotions is a continuum of those same emotions in a variation of intensity, relations and combinations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                HELIOT EMIL’s ‘Compos Mentis’ is an invitation to open up the conversation about our emotions. The theme is expressed through details in the collection such as prints, fabrics and constructions of the garments. HELIOT EMIL’s SS21 collection continues the exploration of form and function and industrial elegance and further cements the HELIOT EMIL silhouette and innovative design approach. Compos Mentis illuminates the cathartic vulnerability of a fully balanced emotional equilibrium. A foundation of classically-sartorial forms and silhouettes echo through HELIOT EMIL’s reputable take on modern tactility. Motifs of harnesses and utilitarianism are deconstructions manifesting through. Julius’ use of fine Italian wools and tanned leathers, visualising a psycho-physical tension for emotion harmony and aesthetical homeostasis.

                    <h2>'SOLITARY UNFORM' AW22</h2>
                        <img src="imgs/heliotemilsolitary.jpeg" alt="heliot emil solitary uniform walking ladies">
                            <div class="item-text">

                                    The Autumn Winter 22 collection titled ‘Solitary Uniform’ explores the idea of a unique uniform. The title reflects an oxymoron: ‘solitary’ implies a detached, disconnected and independent entity, while ‘uniform’ implies an expression of identical form, distinctive design, and a particular interpretation serving as a means of identification. This paradox creates the foundation of the AW22 collection.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Creative Director Julius Juul poses the questions, is it possible to redefine the concept of a ‘uniform’? The concept of the uniform has existed for centuries, so defining time and period is difficult but by working with the components of what makes a uniform and then applying elements unfamiliar to the concept, is it possible to personalise it?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Throughout his research, Julius discovered a documented picture series of workers in a limestone factory. All were individually dressed but through the means of their work environment, their attire looked similar- a solitary uniform. This is brought to life through an exploration of a future uniform, referencing elements of uniforms such as suits, shirts and ties throughout time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Julius explored technology advancements such as; 3D printed garments and accessories and footwear to both minimise waste and improve the level of detail as well as technical developments including RFID GPS Blocking, Anti-Radiation Fabric & Heat Embossed Fabric.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The collection comes as a result of new and innovative approaches, juxtaposed with familiar silhouettes and materials such as wool, leather, organic cotton and steel trimmings. This tension is balanced in an expression of HELIOT EMIL’s signature industrial elegance.

                                    Creative Director Julius Juul, was inspired by the sculptural creations of English artist Henry Moore. Best known for his semi-abstract monumental sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art, Moore uses the human body as reference and creates large scale abstract cast bronze sculptures. Through his art he has had an instrumental impact on introducing a particular form of modernism to the United Kingdom.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Inspired by the sculptural works of Henry Moore, Julius created a collection which questions traditional shapes and patterns. The AW23 collection showcases unique and avant-garde designs that capture the essence of Moore’s art. Many of Moore’s sculptures are displayed outdoors in public space, this gives the artworks a natural patina and a unique texture influenced by the environment of the pieces. In the collection, Juul wanted to provoke the same look and feel of material and texture, this was done by manipulating the fabrics with heat, water and extensive tear.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Other influences from the sculptures are showcased in the form of curved zippers, morphed silhouettes, asymmetrical details, and exaggerated shapes. Organic pattern lines create odd volumes and shapes in the form of sculptural looking jackets, pants and dresses. The asymmetric lines continue even down to the details of pocket flaps and seaming. Each piece in the collection is an interpretation in their own way and captures the essence of Moore’s sculptures.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As part of HELIOT EMIL’s continual exploration into sound this season, Julius collaborated with Stefano Cornali & Mirko Zambelli to create an audio track for the AW23 show. Renowned for their technical prowess and sharp ear for sound design, Cornali & Zambelli were invited to create their interpretation of the AW23 collection.

                                The SS23 Collection is titled ‘Primal Substance’. Creative Director Julius Juul was Inspired by the Bill Viola’s Art Piece: ‘Martyrs Composite’.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The artwork pictures the four prime elements: Water, Earth, Fire, Air and their effects on the human body. Recorded in super slow-motion, the elements interact with the individuals to create a breathtaking visual experience. Taking this concept into consideration, the collection features various inspiration from the primal elements and their effects on the body, examples to highlight are; fabrics reacting to temperature change, using wind turbines to inflate garments, uniquely placed air slips, water resistant fabrics, and details like seam lines referencing the contour lines of earth.            </p>
                            <p>
                                The collection also features a concept collaboration with Alpinestars®, the world-leading manufacturer of professional motorsport performance gear. Alpinestars is named after the perennial Alpine star flower in latin known as the Leontopodium nivale. Found in remote mountain areas like the rocky limestone of the Alps at about 3000m altitude, the flower is able to withstand incredible conditions of the primal elements, referring back to the concept of the collection.

                            <p>
                                To further the sensory experience of the SS23 show, HELIOT EMIL collaborated with UNIFROM, a Swedish based fragrance house. HELIOT EMIL was especially fascinated with the innovative approach of interaction with perfume. Inspired by the concept of the collection, UNIFROM translates the vision into a scent infused with notes of Maté, Sichuan Pepper, Cedarwood and Cinnamon. HELIOT EMIL conceptualised a special perfume bag which integrates the perfume perfectly in the aesthetic of the brand. The scents are conceptualised in Stockholm, developed in Paris, and made in Grasse, all alcohol-free, cruelty-free and vegan.            
                            </p>

                                In a continual exploration into the stimulation of different senses, Julius worked in close collaboration with sound and visual artist Lorem to create an artificial intelligence generated audio track for the show. Lorem is a trans-media project of artist and musician Francesco D’Abbracio. Fascinated by artificial intelligence and the ability of machine generated sound, Lorem works with neural networks and digital systems to create works with a strong narrative component. Lorem was invited to create his interpretation of the HELIOT EMIL SS23 collection for the show.

                            <p>Fashion brand Heliot Emil unveiled its Spring Summer 2024 collection with a fashion show held on Tuesday, September 26th, during the recently finished Paris Fashion Week. The Heliot Emil Spring Summer 2024 collection, provocatively titled ‘The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis,’ delves into the realm of mathematics and nature, drawing its inspiration from a seminal 1952 article penned by the brilliant mathematician and computer scientist, Alan Turing. In this groundbreaking work, Turing masterfully elucidated the intricate interplay between mathematical algorithms and the formation of unique patterns in the natural world.</p>
                            <p>This fascinating exploration led the Creative Director of Heliot Emil, Julius Juul, on a journey to encapsulate the mesmerizing dynamics and profound complexities of morphogenesis within the contours of a fashion collection. The result is a mesmerizing fusion of distinctive textures and patterns intertwined with meticulously calculated mathematical principles.</p>
